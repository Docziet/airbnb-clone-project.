- Ensure **fast loading times**  
- Prioritize **mobile responsiveness**  

###  Key Features
- Property search and filtering  
- Detailed property viewing  
- Secure checkout process  
- User authentication  

###  Primary Pages
| Page                  | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Grid display of available properties with filters             |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Full property details with images and booking form           |
